The Parties further agree:<br />
<br />
<em><u>Entire Agreement.</u> </em>This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, regarding such subject matter.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Amendments</u></em>. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by each Party.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Severability</u></em>. If any term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Waiver</u></em>. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Assignment</u></em>. Neither Party may assign, transfer, delegate or subcontract any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, any party may rely upon employees or independent contractors to perform any work required of it in this agreement, but the Party shall remain ultimately responsible for the completion of that work and its quality. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Relationship of the Parties</u></em>. The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither Party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<em><u>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</u></em>. This Agreement benefits solely the Parties to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, confers on any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.<br />
<br />
<u><em>Indemnification</em></u>. Each Party (the &ldquo;<strong>Indemnifying Party</strong>&rdquo;) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, and agents for any losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) relating to or arising from the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s (i) breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, or covenant in this Agreement, (ii) breach of this Agreement, or (iii) grossly negligent behavior in connection with this Agreement.<br />
<br />
<em><u>Force Majeure</u></em>. Neither Party shall be liable or responsible to the other, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that Party including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot, or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic or pandemic, lock-outs, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to either Party&#39;s workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown or power outage. If the event in question continues for a continuous period in excess of 15 days, either Party shall be entitled to give notice in writing to the other to terminate this Agreement.</p>
","<p>This section includes the boilerplate legal language that should be included in all agreements.<br />
<br />
The Entire Agreement &amp; Amendments clauses work together to mean that this agreement and any later written agreement are the only binding agreements. It prevents either party from claiming there was a side, unwritten agreement.<br />
<br />
The Severability clause means that if something in this agreement is found to be invalid, the rest of the agreement remains in place.<br />
<br />
The Waiver clause allows you to show grace without losing any rights. In other words, if you want to give the other side a break when they don&#39;t live up to the agreement once, you can do that without it meaning you can&#39;t enforce the agreement later.<br />
<br />
The Assignment clause basically says this agreement is only between the parties. Neither party can try to transfer their rights under this agreement to someone else.<br />
<br />
The Relationship of the Parties clause means that nothing about this agreement creates a partnership or anything of the sort.<br />
<br />
The No Third-Party Beneficiaries clause is meant to prevent some unnamed outsider from claiming they have rights under the agreement (and suing you).<br />
<br />
The Indemnification clause means that if either party gets sued by a third party because of the bad behavior of the other party to this agreement, the badly behaving party is responsible for paying for the defense of that suit.<br />
<br />
The Force Majeure clause is sometimes called the &quot;acts of god&quot; clause. It excuses a party from meeting their obligations if they are prevented by a major catastrophe that is outside their control (e.g., a pandemic or invasion of their country).</p>
","As a general rule, you should not touch these clauses. This legalese is there for a reason. If you remove part or all of this clause, you very well might undermine the enforceability of the agreement or create the risk that someone can claim there is an agreement beyond what is written.",,,Miscellaneous Clauses
