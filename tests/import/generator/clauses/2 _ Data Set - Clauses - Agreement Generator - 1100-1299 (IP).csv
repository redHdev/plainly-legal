In some states, an employer needs to have a reason to require an employee to sign a confidentiality agreement. The employee needing to know the information to fulfill their role is one reason that always works. Because of the nature of work in the online business world, that rationale will always apply.",Do not remove this clause. Any employee who has access to confidential information should be someone who needs access to that information. This clause ensures that the agreement is enforceable. Removing this clause could make the agreement subject to challenge later.,,,Acknowledgement

To the maximum extent allowed by law, the Employee acknowledges that all Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights created during the Employee&rsquo;s employment with the Employer are and shall be the exclusive property of the Employer. To the extent necessary by law, the Employee agrees to assign and hereby does assign all rights, title, and interest in all Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights created during the Employee&rsquo;s employment with the Employer. Further to this provision, the Parties agree as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
        <li><u>Work Product.</u> The Employee hereby irrevocably agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to all Work Product as well as any and all Intellectual Property Rights therein and all improvements thereto shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Employer. The Work Product shall at all times remain the confidential information of the Employer, and the Employer shall have the unrestricted right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (i) use, commercialize, or otherwise exploit any Work Product or (ii) file an application for patent, copyright registration, or registration of any other Intellectual Property Rights, and prosecute or abandon such application prior to issuance or registration. No royalty or other consideration shall be due or owing to the Employee now or in the future as a result of such activities.<br />
        </li>
        <li><u>Work Made for Hire.</u> The Employee acknowledges that, to the extent permitted by law, all Work Product consisting of copyrightable subject matter is &ldquo;work made for hire&rdquo; as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. &sect; 101), and such copyrights are therefore owned by the Employer.<br />
        </li>
        <li><u>Assignment.</u>To the extent that the foregoing provisions are insufficient or do not apply, the Employee hereby irrevocably agrees to assign and hereby does assign to the Employer the Employee&rsquo;s entire right, title, and interest in and to all Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights.<br />
        </li>
        <li><u>Duty To Cooperate.</u> During and after the Employee&rsquo;s employment, the Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Employer to (i) apply for, obtain, perfect, and transfer to the Employer the Work Product as well as any and all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product in any jurisdiction throughout the world, and (ii) maintain, protect, and enforce the same.<br />
        </li>
        <li><u>Power of Attorney.</u> The Employee hereby irrevocably grants the Employer power of attorney to execute and deliver any such documents on the Employee&rsquo;s behalf in the Employee&rsquo;s name and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to transfer legal ownership of the Work Product to the Employer and further the transfer, prosecution, issuance, and maintenance of all Intellectual Property Rights, to the full extent permitted by law, if the Employee does not promptly cooperate with the Employer&#39;s request (without limiting the rights the Employer shall have in such circumstances by operation of law). This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by the Employee&#39;s subsequent incapacity.</li>
</ul>","This section is what actually transfers ownership of all work to the company. It is set up with a belt-and-suspenders approach.

This is a standard clause for all confidentiality clauses. This clause also requries the party who receives a court order to notify the party who originally disclosed the information. That notification is intended to give the disclosing party the chance to oppose the court order.,"Do not remove this clause.
