<br />

As a condition of your employment, you will be required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement that will protect that information and limit your ability to use it outside of your employment with {company_name}.<br />
<br />
I also anticipate that during the course of your employment, you will contribute to the creation of certain intellectual property for the company.
