To be clear, you will generally always be personally liable for your own actions.

Creating an LLC will shield your personal assets from claims arising from wrongdoing by one of your team members.",

If you don&apos;t deal with this task now, you might find yourself having to change your brand on an emergency basis later if someone owns the trademark and comes after you.",

Ensuring accessibility is a long-term project for most websites; it is something you&apos;ll likely need to do in stages.

Think through how to store files so that you can limit access to the most sensitive information only to those who need to know it.",
